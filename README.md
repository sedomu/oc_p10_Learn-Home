# OpenClassrooms ‚Äì Project 10 Learn@Home

## üìå Description

Source code of **Project 10 ‚Äì Learn@Home**, completed as part of the **OpenClassrooms JavaScript React Developer path**.

This project focused on **defining the front-end design** for an educational support platform connecting students with volunteer tutors.
The main goals were to **understand user needs, model a technical solution, and design a functional interface** before development.

The association **Learn@Home** connects children facing academic difficulties with volunteer tutors.
Each student is assigned a volunteer tutor who supports them through short weekly sessions, helping them with homework and organisation. The goal of this project was to create a clear and functional design for a platform to facilitate communication and interactions between students and tutors.
